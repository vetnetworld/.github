## Hi there 👋

We’re **VetNet** – a small Scandinavian team building software for veterinary clinics and the people who keep animals healthy. 🐶🐱🐴

### What we do

- Build and maintain a veterinary **practice management / EMR system** used in day-to-day clinic work  
- Modernise a long-lived **desktop app** while growing a new, cloud-based platform  
- Obsess over workflows: bookings, records, meds, billing and all the glue in between

### What you’ll find in this org

- Legacy code we still love (and refactor) 🧹  
- New greenfield projects where we try out modern tooling and architecture  
- Small utilities and integrations that make clinic life a bit less painful

### Tech we like

C++ & Qt · TypeScript · React · Node.js · PostgreSQL · AWS · “Whatever solves the problem without making tomorrow harder”

### How we work

- Tiny team, close to our users  
- Pragmatic over perfect, but serious about **stability, data, and patient safety**  
- Incremental change > big bangs
